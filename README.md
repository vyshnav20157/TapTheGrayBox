# TapTheGrayBox

I have just uploaded the assignment that I completed within the given deadline. <br>
The APK file called "TapTheGrayBox.apk" can be found in this directory. <br>
Kindly try downloading from this link as Google mistakenly flags the app as having a virus. I have run a custom scan via Microsoft Defender on this entire folder and the APK file, and Defender says there is no issue with it. It is completely safe to download. <br><br>
