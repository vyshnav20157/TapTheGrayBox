# TapTheGrayBox

There seems to be a problem where Google mistakenly flags the app as having a virus eventhough it does not. (I have confirmed it via Microsoft Defender and Xiaomi Antivirus) <br><br>

I have just uploaded the assignment that I completed within the given deadline on GitHub.<br>
The APK file called "TapTheGrayBox.apk" can be found in the root directory.<br>
